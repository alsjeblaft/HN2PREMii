# Redirect HN to Premii

This extension catches all links to Hacker News and redirects them to hn.premii.com for a better reading experience. Credit goes to Premii (https://github.com/premii) for hn.premii.com and Beasta (https://github.com/beasta) for writing the javascript where the magic happens. All I did was pack it up, cough up the $5 developer fee and upload it to the Chrome Web Store so I can use it without Chrome nagging me for using an unpacked extension.

Please note: The "inline article view" appears to be broken at the moment. Clicking the article link results in a "Unable to load the content" message. This issue is documented at https://github.com/premii/hn/issues/29. As far as I know there's no workaround at this time, except for just loading the actual article.
